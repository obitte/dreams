    <h4 class="live"> Emeka called and argued about how the salary will not enter. And how a shift manager even confirmed it, stating that it will be floated today to be effective tomorrow.
            I explained that since yesterday was weekend, the lon will be floated today, to be effective tomorrow. I told him they will do a idrect transfer today but he doubted that.
            He put me through approving my certificate of employment from Randstad through Ifmetal. I did, and thereafter sent it to TSL. WHile speaking with him, Eric called and I asked for permission to call him 
            back later since I was in a meeting. Later, I called Eric and he proposed he will transfer me to another company to have a partnership. It was obvious he didn't want to have the partnership with me anymore.
            I politely rejected his proposaland rather proposed I run the show solely for one or two months, during which I will look for another partner. I explained how improper it will look to go back to the client and make a switch at this time.
            He wasn't prepared for that. He asked that we discuss this later, which I obliged.
            I got a response/reminder from TSL, and in response to that, I sent them the employment certificate from Randstad AB (i had downloaded it after approval), and wrote Kavallariette AB bankrupcy Trustees.
            I called a trafik school to book appointment for 5pm Wednesday 27th for Risk 1. I asked for another time because I have a cofee date with Malik and family on the same date, even though we had not agreed on time.

    <h3>26th November 2024</h3>
<h4>Eric called later to insist he cannot let me use his company, he insisted on introducing me to his friend, whom he has gone ahead to speak with without my consent.
    I sent a message to Charles about Norway, I also messaged him about a transport/logistic company I could do business with.
    I sent a message to Ken to give me Chidi's number. Charles called back on a conference regarding Norway and we spoke with someone who did all but encouraged me. Together with Charles they tried dissuading me from doing the stockfish business. He eventually said he had no contact but promised to contact someone who used to do the business.
    Ssaid he would reach Charles to reach me. I took his number from the group call. I called Chidi but he has no good information for me.
    Emeka-sweden chatted me from Canada. They moved late last year. I had told Charles about my situation in Northvolt. I did the same to Emeka.
    My wife called around 1am and we spoke till 1.30 when Jesse woke up and leaned in briefly in the chat.
   I woke up just before 8am, a call from my sons. We chatted until they got to school, it was a video call. They were using google map and I gave them my address, which they tried locating.
   They excused me when they got to school. My wife went to check on the ACs - LG, Hisense. I reached Ben later and contacted the Firman guy and got a better deal. Eric called around 11am and we agreed that the meeting will be held between 4 and 5pm when I would have started my Swedish class. I left for the busstation at 12.45 to meet the bus scheduled for 14.45. I met a ladey there Andchatted her up, Eno is 
   her na,e, she is from Oron. SHe headed to Lidl while I headed to Willys when we got to Skelleftea. I bought some mannagryn and potatis or so. I missed the 16.45 bus to class and had to wait for the 17.15 bus.
   I was the last in the class. I rode home with Hossein after the class. Just like every other day he drove me home aftter class, he talked all through the journey.
   Eric had sent a text to inform the other guy was fully booked and rescheduled for Friday. I simply said Ok. It was getting very frustrating but there was nothign I could do.
   Just before getting to class, I sent 455k to the Firman guy and told my wife to send me the 200k she said she had saved. She said it was in her savings account and that she will go to the bank the next day to transfer it.
   At home, Blessing chatted to inform that NIMC insisted Philo must come in person to fix her NIN.
