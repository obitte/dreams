    <h4 class="live"> Emeka called and argued about how the salary will not enter. And how a shift manager even confirmed it, stating that it will be floated today to be effective tomorrow.
            I explained that since yesterday was weekend, the lon will be floated today, to be effective tomorrow. I told him they will do a idrect transfer today but he doubted that.
            He put me through approving my certificate of employment from Randstad through Ifmetal. I did, and thereafter sent it to TSL. WHile speaking with him, Eric called and I asked for permission to call him 
            back later since I was in a meeting. Later, I called Eric and he proposed he will transfer me to another company to have a partnership. It was obvious he didn't want to have the partnership with me anymore.
            I politely rejected his proposaland rather proposed I run the show solely for one or two months, during which I will look for another partner. I explained how improper it will look to go back to the client and make a switch at this time.
            He wasn't prepared for that. He asked that we discuss this later, which I obliged.
            I got a response/reminder from TSL, and in response to that, I sent them the employment certificate from Randstad AB (i had downloaded it after approval), and wrote Kavallariette AB bankrupcy Trustees.
            I called a trafik school to book appointment for 5pm Wednesday 27th for Risk 1. I asked for another time because I have a cofee date with Malik and family on the same date, even though we had not agreed on time.

    <h3>26th November 2024</h3>
<h4>Eric called later to insist he cannot let me use his company, he insisted on introducing me to his friend, whom he has gone ahead to speak with without my consent.
    I sent a message to Charles about Norway, I also messaged him about a transport/logistic company I could do business with.
    I sent a message to Ken to give me Chidi's number. Charles called back on a conference regarding Norway and we spoke with someone who did all but encouraged me. Together with Charles they tried dissuading me from doing the stockfish business. He eventually said he had no contact but promised to contact someone who used to do the business.
    Ssaid he would reach Charles to reach me. I took his number from the group call. I called Chidi but he has no good information for me.
    Emeka-sweden chatted me from Canada. They moved late last year. I had told Charles about my situation in Northvolt. I did the same to Emeka.
    My wife called around 1am and we spoke till 1.30 when Jesse woke up and leaned in briefly in the chat.
   I woke up just before 8am, a call from my sons. We chatted until they got to school, it was a video call. They were using google map and I gave them my address, which they tried locating.
   They excused me when they got to school. My wife went to check on the ACs - LG, Hisense. I reached Ben later and contacted the Firman guy and got a better deal. Eric called around 11am and we agreed that the meeting will be held between 4 and 5pm when I would have started my Swedish class. I left for the busstation at 12.45 to meet the bus scheduled for 14.45. I met a ladey there Andchatted her up, Eno is 
   her na,e, she is from Oron. SHe headed to Lidl while I headed to Willys when we got to Skelleftea. I bought some mannagryn and potatis or so. I missed the 16.45 bus to class and had to wait for the 17.15 bus.
   I was the last in the class. I rode home with Hossein after the class. Just like every other day he drove me home aftter class, he talked all through the journey.
   Eric had sent a text to inform the other guy was fully booked and rescheduled for Friday. I simply said Ok. It was getting very frustrating but there was nothign I could do.
   Just before getting to class, I sent 455k to the Firman guy and told my wife to send me the 200k she said she had saved. She said it was in her savings account and that she will go to the bank the next day to transfer it.
   At home, Blessing chatted to inform that NIMC insisted Philo must come in person to fix her NIN.

 <h5> I woke up somewhat late and cleared up the parlour. Time was shot so I didn't study and got ready and left for Coop (I had gotten a message from DB Schenker that my parcel from Temu has arrived. It was -17 degree cenlcius outside.
  While heading out I noticed my neighbour's trailer actually has the second tyre. I decided i would talk to him tomorrow.  I got to Coop and picked up the package, then I headed to Malik's. I arrived aroun 14:05 for a 14:00 visit.
  We had come nice time with his wife, and, at 14:20 she started bringing out dishes. I checked the bus schedule and noticed if I missed the 14:55 bus that I would be arriving Schelleftea at 17:35 for a 17:00 Risk 1 session,
 I pleaded I wouldn't be able to eat, it was abrupt and I felt a little embaraased myself, but I had to do it. They understood but suggested I take the food in a pack along. I agreed so I don't offend them. I hurriedly dished some food
 into the pack and took the spoon and can of coke they offered me. Ask for directlion and apologised and ran off. It was a longer distance that I though so I ran faster. I continued towards teh E4 and got tired as the bussyop was nowhere in sight.
 I figured it was still a little far ahead and I saw the bus coming behind. I stopped, turned towards the bus and started waving frantically. He stopped and I jumped in. I thanked him as I panted like an exhausted leopard. I developed cough and coughed all through the journey, it was dues to the sudden intense exercise.
  I ate the food as soon as I settled in the bus.
  I got to Skelleftea wuite early and located the driving school about 5 minutes later. I saw a message from Theo asking for update so I decided to let him in on my challenge. He understood (or so he made me feel). I assured him Iw as on it. I entered stationsgatan 22 and met Thelma.It was past 4pm. Bob arrived around 4.30 and opened the door.
  While inside, Erika arrived, as well as other students. I allowed Thelma register before I did. The fee was 1,100 Kr. We met Regina, whose vias was to expire on 10th of December.
  We were 8 students in all, 4 Nigerians, one Russian and likely 3 Swedish. The Session was interesting and we were there till 20:15, it had started exactly at 17:00.
  I sat with Regina and advised her on how to navigate her visa wahala. They all left before me, Thelma to Skellefthamn, Regina and the other guy towards Solbacken. I chatted briefly with Bob after all had left vefore I took my leave. I was reluctant because my bus to JÃ¶rn was at 22:15. I went to the 
  busstation and waited out the time. I communicated Blessing and she had gotten the feedback I expected to read, the NIMC thief has demanded 20k to sift the suspension temporarily. I sent the message immediately to the appropriate quarter. Asked for how long the ban lifting will last and she said she will ask the next day.
  I read a message from my wife that she couldn't effect the transfer for some reasons, I had a feeling she had no money anywehere.
  During and after the Risk1 lesson, my mind drawn to paying for the 'full' driving lesson package. 
  I am tying at 2:53 and temperature is -18 degree celcius. It is 28th November, 2024.

<h4> 29-11-24</h4>
<h5> I woke up at 8.49 and freshened up and headed out to my neighbour- the old couple living in the red house by the left of my house. Unfortunately, no one was at home, or rather, no one came to the door. I was a little dissapointed but it just meant preparing to spend about 400Kr
  I called Malik once I got home, around 9.33 and told him we have to go to Boliden for the trailer. He fixed 10.15 and said he will come to pick me from home. Around 10.18 he called to tell me he was outside.
  We headed to Boliden, rented the Trailer for 489Kr or so and headed to his house. The old couple who are their neighbour were so welcoming and playful, too playful for their age if you ask me. Malik's wife ask if I wanted the tv bank and I said yes. Then the old woman asked if I owned a tv and I said no. She asked if I needed one and I said yes. Then she offered to give me a tv, a 43 inches samsung non-smart tv, remote intact. I thanked her.
  We loaded the stuff into my garage and I moved the sofa to the sitting room. I joined back to Boliden where Is ent the RAM sticks back to china through Postnord at ICA. When I came home, my sitting had a different smell. I couldn't bear it, and in a second, I regretted buying all the furniture.
  I spayed the perfume I bought from H&M and it masked the smell to an extent. Before Malik left he asked if I had sent the money, I asked for his account details and ensured I sent the money as soon as I settled down. It was 2,500kr. 
</h5>
<h4>30-11-24</h4>
<h5>I woke up late. My last dream was about MC reality. He was dragging a girl to go and rape. I stopped and cautioned him. The family of the girl later arrived. Now I have forgotten every other part of the dream.
I called Tony later to tell him of my business plan and he promised to shop around for a potential partner. Eric never got back to me. Mikael wasn't taking my calls until Jerome asvised I send him a message introducing myself as coming from him (Jerome), which I did. Imediately Mikael called me back.
He said he couldn't help me because he only has a license for 2 cars, and he already has two cars. I thanked him. Ozioma sent a message for a call and I fixed it for 15.05. Teh AC arrived PH today and my wife sent bro Austin to go pick it up. We had to pay 8k to pick it. The installer promised to come but didn't sho up eventually. He promised to come next day.</h5>
