    <h4 class="live"> Emeka called and argued about how the salary will not enter. And how a shift manager even confirmed it, stating that it will be floated today to be effective tomorrow.
            I explained that since yesterday was weekend, the lon will be floated today, to be effective tomorrow. I told him they will do a idrect transfer today but he doubted that.
            He put me through approving my certificate of employment from Randstad through Ifmetal. I did, and thereafter sent it to TSL. WHile speaking with him, Eric called and I asked for permission to call him 
            back later since I was in a meeting. Later, I called Eric and he proposed he will transfer me to another company to have a partnership. It was obvious he didn't want to have the partnership with me anymore.
            I politely rejected his proposaland rather proposed I run the show solely for one or two months, during which I will look for another partner. I explained how improper it will look to go back to the client and make a switch at this time.
            He wasn't prepared for that. He asked that we discuss this later, which I obliged.
            I got a response/reminder from TSL, and in response to that, I sent them the employment certificate from Randstad AB (i had downloaded it after approval), and wrote Kavallariette AB bankrupcy Trustees.
            I called a trafik school to book appointment for 5pm Wednesday 27th for Risk 1. I asked for another time because I have a cofee date with Malik and family on the same date, even though we had not agreed on time.

    <h3>26th November 2024</h3>
<h5>Eric called later to insist he cannot let me use his company, he insisted on introducing me to his friend, whom he has gone ahead to speak with without my consent.
    I sent a message to Charles about Norway, I also messaged him about a transport/logistic company I could do business with.
    I sent a message to Ken to give me Chidi's number. Charles called back on a conference regarding Norway and we spoke with someone who did all but encouraged me. Together with Charles they tried dissuading me from doing the stockfish business. He eventually said he had no contact but promised to contact someone who used to do the business.
    Ssaid he would reach Charles to reach me. I took his number from the group call. I called Chidi but he has no good information for me.
    Emeka-sweden chatted me from Canada. They moved late last year. I had told Charles about my situation in Northvolt. I did the same to Emeka.
    My wife called around 1am and we spoke till 1.30 when Jesse woke up and leaned in briefly in the chat.
   I woke up just before 8am, a call from my sons. We chatted until they got to school, it was a video call. They were using google map and I gave them my address, which they tried locating.
   They excused me when they got to school. My wife went to check on the ACs - LG, Hisense. I reached Ben later and contacted the Firman guy and got a better deal. Eric called around 11am and we agreed that the meeting will be held between 4 and 5pm when I would have started my Swedish class. I left for the busstation at 12.45 to meet the bus scheduled for 14.45. I met a ladey there Andchatted her up, Eno is 
   her na,e, she is from Oron. SHe headed to Lidl while I headed to Willys when we got to Skelleftea. I bought some mannagryn and potatis or so. I missed the 16.45 bus to class and had to wait for the 17.15 bus.
   I was the last in the class. I rode home with Hossein after the class. Just like every other day he drove me home aftter class, he talked all through the journey.
   Eric had sent a text to inform the other guy was fully booked and rescheduled for Friday. I simply said Ok. It was getting very frustrating but there was nothign I could do.
   Just before getting to class, I sent 455k to the Firman guy and told my wife to send me the 200k she said she had saved. She said it was in her savings account and that she will go to the bank the next day to transfer it.
   At home, Blessing chatted to inform that NIMC insisted Philo must come in person to fix her NIN.

 <h4>27-11-24</h4>
 <h5> I woke up somewhat late and cleared up the parlour. Time was shot so I didn't study and got ready and left for Coop (I had gotten a message from DB Schenker that my parcel from Temu has arrived. It was -17 degree cenlcius outside.
  While heading out I noticed my neighbour's trailer actually has the second tyre. I decided i would talk to him tomorrow.  I got to Coop and picked up the package, then I headed to Malik's. I arrived aroun 14:05 for a 14:00 visit.
  We had come nice time with his wife, and, at 14:20 she started bringing out dishes. I checked the bus schedule and noticed if I missed the 14:55 bus that I would be arriving Schelleftea at 17:35 for a 17:00 Risk 1 session,
 I pleaded I wouldn't be able to eat, it was abrupt and I felt a little embaraased myself, but I had to do it. They understood but suggested I take the food in a pack along. I agreed so I don't offend them. I hurriedly dished some food
 into the pack and took the spoon and can of coke they offered me. Ask for directlion and apologised and ran off. It was a longer distance that I though so I ran faster. I continued towards teh E4 and got tired as the bussyop was nowhere in sight.
 I figured it was still a little far ahead and I saw the bus coming behind. I stopped, turned towards the bus and started waving frantically. He stopped and I jumped in. I thanked him as I panted like an exhausted leopard. I developed cough and coughed all through the journey, it was dues to the sudden intense exercise.
  I ate the food as soon as I settled in the bus.
  I got to Skelleftea wuite early and located the driving school about 5 minutes later. I saw a message from Theo asking for update so I decided to let him in on my challenge. He understood (or so he made me feel). I assured him Iw as on it. I entered stationsgatan 22 and met Thelma.It was past 4pm. Bob arrived around 4.30 and opened the door.
  While inside, Erika arrived, as well as other students. I allowed Thelma register before I did. The fee was 1,100 Kr. We met Regina, whose vias was to expire on 10th of December.
  We were 8 students in all, 4 Nigerians, one Russian and likely 3 Swedish. The Session was interesting and we were there till 20:15, it had started exactly at 17:00.
  I sat with Regina and advised her on how to navigate her visa wahala. They all left before me, Thelma to Skellefthamn, Regina and the other guy towards Solbacken. I chatted briefly with Bob after all had left vefore I took my leave. I was reluctant because my bus to Jörn was at 22:15. I went to the 
  busstation and waited out the time. I communicated Blessing and she had gotten the feedback I expected to read, the NIMC thief has demanded 20k to sift the suspension temporarily. I sent the message immediately to the appropriate quarter. Asked for how long the ban lifting will last and she said she will ask the next day.
  I read a message from my wife that she couldn't effect the transfer for some reasons, I had a feeling she had no money anywehere.
  During and after the Risk1 lesson, my mind drawn to paying for the 'full' driving lesson package. 
  I am tying at 2:53 and temperature is -18 degree celcius. It is 28th November, 2024.

<h4> 29-11-24</h4>
<h5> I woke up at 8.49 and freshened up and headed out to my neighbour- the old couple living in the red house by the left of my house. Unfortunately, no one was at home, or rather, no one came to the door. I was a little dissapointed but it just meant preparing to spend about 400Kr
  I called Malik once I got home, around 9.33 and told him we have to go to Boliden for the trailer. He fixed 10.15 and said he will come to pick me from home. Around 10.18 he called to tell me he was outside.
  We headed to Boliden, rented the Trailer for 489Kr or so and headed to his house. The old couple who are their neighbour were so welcoming and playful, too playful for their age if you ask me. Malik's wife ask if I wanted the tv bank and I said yes. Then the old woman asked if I owned a tv and I said no. She asked if I needed one and I said yes. Then she offered to give me a tv, a 43 inches samsung non-smart tv, remote intact. I thanked her.
  We loaded the stuff into my garage and I moved the sofa to the sitting room. I joined back to Boliden where Is ent the RAM sticks back to china through Postnord at ICA. When I came home, my sitting had a different smell. I couldn't bear it, and in a second, I regretted buying all the furniture.
  I spayed the perfume I bought from H&M and it masked the smell to an extent. Before Malik left he asked if I had sent the money, I asked for his account details and ensured I sent the money as soon as I settled down. It was 2,500kr. 
</h5>
<h4>30-11-24</h4>
<h5>I woke up late. My last dream was about MC reality. He was dragging a girl to go and rape. I stopped and cautioned him. The family of the girl later arrived. Now I have forgotten every other part of the dream.
I called Tony later to tell him of my business plan and he promised to shop around for a potential partner. Eric never got back to me. Mikael wasn't taking my calls until Jerome asvised I send him a message introducing myself as coming from him (Jerome), which I did. Imediately Mikael called me back.
He said he couldn't help me because he only has a license for 2 cars, and he already has two cars. I thanked him. Ozioma sent a message for a call and I fixed it for 15.05. Teh AC arrived PH today and my wife sent bro Austin to go pick it up. We had to pay 8k to pick it. The installer promised to come but didn't sho up eventually. He promised to come next day.</h5>
<h4>1-12-24</h4>
<h5> I was told the AC guy came to install the AC. Jesse cried about needing Crab, Lobster and Octopus. Joined a family meeting to speak with Mma at 4pm. Tony called me around 8 and said he has seen a willing partner who is willing to rent out his company to me. He however said he can't really place my face and would like to have a video call with me. I agreed to that.
 He however said he was entering a meeting by 8pm and would call after the meeting. I prepared and waited for his call but 23.38 he wrote "Good evening, we just finished the meeting now. We will talk tomorrow evening because l will be going to work tomorrow early morning. Good night".  I replied "no wahala. Good night".
 I checked on Eric with "hej bro, how are you? Been waiting for your feedback. How did the meeting go?". I checked Electricity price and saw it was 0.14 ore/kwh and would be 0 ore/kwh from 0.00. I turned on the freeze at 23.46 and headed to the garage and stripped the smelly pillows of their cases. I loaded the washing machine.
 Past 0.00 I took out a scumbia fish and prepared it for the oven. I took out the other took fish and clean them up and put back in the freezer.
 I chatted her to talk about her visa runs and she was not 100% clean about it. She was defensive and started a shouting march which led to her mother coming out to ask her what was wrong. She wouldn't give me any information about her agents and within me I made up my mind not to come to her rescue if she scams anyone and the person comes after her. I wrote the pastor and advised him to stand off and promised to investigate further.
 </h5>
 <h4> 2-12-24</h4>
 <h5> I washed the dirty clothes and the smelly bedspreads and pillow cases. I added perfume to the softener while washing the smelly pillow cases. Once I loaded the last batch of sheets in the machine, I stepped outside to position the trash bins (the trash truck is expected next day and I know I may not be awake when it comes). After that, I retired for the night around 4am
 Jesse woke me with a call at past 7am. We spoke until they were too busy with tv. I left home by 10.15 to the busstation. I had called Jerome before I left and he confirmed he was home. I headed to his place and stayed with him until 12.51pm. Eric replied. "I actually never really had time for the meeting". "And I think it is best that you are also partaking in it!" "Since you are the ones that would partner up"
I got to the class around 1pm and called Hossein and he confirmed the time was to be 1.30pm. I waited. We were 3 for the class between 1.30 to 4pm. The other 2 left and I waited for the next class at 5pm. The second class was more advanced but I somehow managed. I was tired and sleepy.
  I camed back with hossein and I chatted Tony. He promised to call me soon. This was 21.29.
 </h5>
 <h4>
4th December 2024</h4>
<h5>I went to Skelleftea and arrived quite early. I went to LIDL to get bread and cornflakes. I didn't pick the washing machine softner because there seemed not to be a space for it in my bag.
I saw blower and decided I would buy it later, it was about 500kr. I went to the driving school and met nobody. Chatted Regina and she was in the library. I was with her until she left at 12 for 
her next driving lesson. She expressed some disatisfaction with the lessons. I left for Medlefors at past 12.</h5>
 <h4> 5th December, 2024</h4>
 <h5>
I left for Skelleftea with the 14.55 bus and in the bus I spoke with Jerome. Jerome told me what CHidi did to him when he was his landlord. It was almost exactly what CHidi had complained someone else did to him that
made them end up in court. Jerome planted some form of resentment against CHidi in me, I started putting two and two together. Why would CHidi tell me he knew someone who had done exactly the same kind of business I was 
seeking information about refused to link me with the person because he felt the person was not a good person and would make me have a negative experience? The 'bad behaviour' he referred to was about bragging. Should that 
be enough? Well, I decided I was going to call him to insist I experience 'the bad behaviour/bragging', but first i would wait for Tony's feedback. I went to Skelleftea and directly to Willys and picked up 9 pieces of peanut chocolates. I headed back to centrum and was on time to catch the
4.45 bus to Uppligsvagen. I arrived the class before it started.
I went home with Hossein and it was on the way he onformed me of France's paliamentary decision to force the Prime Minister to resign. He also informed me that The
rebels were advancing into Syrian capital. I notified him of my trip. I messaged Tony to get a feedback regarding CHidi and he informed he sent someone to call him and that Chidi told the 
person it was not his company. Tony told me he was not really in good talking terms with Chidi, and then he went ahead to tell me the issue they had in the past. It was almost exactly what Chidi had
told me, but CHidi had ommitted some of his actions that made him fall out with Tony. I kinda believed Tony more and was beginning to see the evil side of Chidi. I told Tony my discussion with Chid and told him I would call Chidi
to request to link up with the 'bragger'.
I packed both bags (the one going to naija and the one I would travel to Stockholm with). I set the geothermal heat pump to 'holiday' mode and left home at 23.03 or so. I had two bags that seems a little heavy and not less that 1km to the train station.
I got to the station around 23.25 or so, the same time bus 205 arrived from Skelleftea. A woman from the bus was also travelling by the train. We had some sketchy communication in Swedish while we waited. I was exhausted from the long walk with the luggages. 
The train delayed for 2 minutes and arrived at 23.39. We boarded. 
I noticed the train took only about 1hr 30mins or so to arrive Umea (a trip that would take me about 3 hrs 30mins by bus). I was dissappointed in the train because I couldn't locate the charging ports, and the train has no wifi. 
</h5>
 <h4>
6th December, 2024</h4>
 <h5>

I cordinated the transporter and he sent his boy to pick up the bag from Uppsala. I jumped back into the train and continued to Stockholm.
In Stockholm, I notified Eric when I arrived and waited. He later informed me he would be done with his last dropoff at 12.30. He had wanted me to come meet him in town but I told him I would wait in the station (I wasn't ready to start carrying bag all around town). At 12. 45, I informed him I was leaving for Sodertailje and hope to meet him in Satra at 16.00. He
sent me the Satra address. I bought a ticket from Presbyran and jumped into the pengetag heading to Sodertailje. I managed to get a charging port and powered my phone a (my whatsapp phone had gone off). I sensed some form of cocky responses from Eric. I got to Sodertailje centrum and found a bus (777) to the house viewing. It was a spacious 1 bedroom (Swedish 2-room) apartment.
I finished viewing and left immediately. SL app showed I have to get to Satra through Liljeholmen by bus, then red line. I was at the bus stop at 14.59 but the bus (747) arrived at 15.12. The bus met some trafic jam and we arrived Liljeholmen later than planned. I eventually arroive Satra at 16.09, Eric was waiting for me at the metro station. It was another bus he drove. I asked why and he said he would tell me later. He took me straight to Anders, who welcomed me quite warmly. 
He was older than I had thought , but more receptive that I had expected. We got down to the meeting quickly. Eric briefed him in Swedish, he spoke to me in English. I did not protest any language infraction. He was positive and understood my proposal to summarily mean: "You want us to invoice budbee for you, then you invoice, and then we take a percentage as commision, maybe 5 or 10%". I affirmed his conclusion
and went ahead to add that the drivers would be employed through his company, and that his company will pay Govt tax. They had mentioned 'Collective Agreement' while he and Eric spoke in Swedish. It wan then I understood that Eric did not have the requisite licence(s) to partner with me. There and then, all the resentment i had harboured against him vanished. Anders asked that we should go back and put our request in writing, that his brain was not settled. I promised to so so same night.
We left on foot. Eric went to keep the blankets he removed from the car he drove in his storage at the basement. We left for the city centre to meet one of his friends whom he said they had planned dinner. My protest was weak, I had thought he would be sensitive to know that I should be tired after a long train ride.
On the way, he explained to me how all 3 of his cars were down. The peugeot didn't pass inspection, the caddy broke down while it was rented out, and he had an accident with the big bus after the sun gave him a partial blindness that led him to crash into a stationary truck.
We met Eliot (the guy with dread). I had some pizza and they were planning to have another meetup for cofee. My protest became stronger. Eliot left for a personal assignment and Eric said he got word that the other meetup was cancelled. We left for his house. Thinking I would move around a lot the next day, I bought a train ticket for the whole day. We got home and gisted till around 2am. I suspected Eric went out to smoke after he came back from the groceries.
Earlier in the morning,around 11,  I had tried calling Chidi on Whatsapp but the number was not connecting, even though he made a post in the group chat at about the same time. While in the train heading home, I tried calling him again and it was same. It then dawned on me the bastard seems to have blocked me. I used my new line to call him on regular. It rang, he picked and kept quiet. He repeated this for 2 times and the 3rd time I called him 'Agu' and he responded. I identified myself and 
he sounded a little dissappointed. I made my request and he said the same thing about tghe duy bragging. I told him I was ready to manage the brag and learn one or two. He then said he didn't have the guy's number. I confirmed my thoughts and thanked him.
  I saw Regina's message saying she went to take some driving lessons in Pitea. She gave good testimonies, and it was 50% cheaper. I decided to cancel my booked classes and try Pitea. She sent me the contact upon request.

</h5>
 <h4>7th December,2024</h4>
 <h5>
We woke up around 11am and Eric was to attend CHristmas party at Ander's company. We agreed to meet after he is done so we head to SOdermalm for a sandwich, swimming and sauna. He urged me to watch the flat earth theorists video. His house was dirty (he had apologised about that when we came in the previous night). As soon as he left, I went into the kithcen and washed all his dirty dishes. I vaccuumed the small free space in the sitting room, and then some parts of the bedroom and kitchen.
Thereafter, I headed to Alby. I couln't locate the shop where I bought plantain last time. I messaged Jerome but he wouldn't answer. I started calling him but he was on another call. Alby didn't look like the place, I went to Fitja and it was same. I went back to Alby after Jerome said it was ALby, but nothing. I went back to Fitja and nothing. Eric was done and waiting. I had no more time so I headed to Satra. We ehaded to Sodermalm. Eric had come with 4 cans of beer from the party.
We met Niklas, and while there,Eliot and ALex joined us. They all swam and went to the sauna except me. I just didn't feel like suddenly. 
</h5>
<h4>
8th December, 2024
</h4>
 <h5>We left Niklas place around 00.30 and walked down to Slussen. Everywhere was busy like it was 8pm. We boarded the bus at 1.18 or so. Eric saw his sink empty of dirty dishes and appreciated it. We talked till around 4am when he set up my bed. I went to bed. That night I saw Patience and someone else doing wrong thing. I rebuked them and any impending danger after I woke up.
We were both awake around 12noon. Eric said he has a job at Karlavgaen. I took my bag and we left around 1.45pm. We got off at Karlaplan and salked to Barneagatan, where he carried the tv bank and centre table for over 1km. I helped him take the table to tghe first floor. The owner was moving into a new apartment, and the long distance movement was done by Eric and the man's son.
We walked to Valhalbagen (more than 2km) to attend a church service. The man (Swedish) and his wife (Ugandan), and 8 other invitees were in attendance. A preacher from Smaland ministered. Immediately after the service Eric left. My calls to him later were not answered. I took tea and some confectionery. I lefte to meet Eric at Radmansgatan. He said he felt like eating acwhole grilled chicken. I said why not, and we headed out in search of it. Some told him what I told him, the best place to look for it was 
the grocery stores. We ended up having dinner at pizza hut. All these was around tcentralene. After the meal (202kr), we headed to the train station. 

Eric engage some Syrian brandishing his counrty flag and sho supported the rebel forces.  % other Syrians joined in the conversation. They spoke in Swedsih.
When it was time to board the train, we headed to track 12. Eric saw two of the Syrians sitted and he tried to discharge me. He though I had left and I saw him lighting his cigarrete with their lighter. After settling in the train, Icame out to big him farwell and reminded him to look out for myu interest in the relationship with Anders. His cigarette was more than halfway burnt. He looked embarassed but I pretended it was nothing. I hugged him and left. I made the attendant show me the charging points. I unsuccessfully tried connecting wifi after bringing out my laptop.
Later the attendant told another passenger there was not wii in the train, even though it had indicated so. An old lady sat beside me. I decided to update my journey story. Now it is 23.25, I will hotspot my phone and do some codecademy,then I will watch some youtube on phone, and perhaps sleep. I had done some Duolingo on my phone before I started typing.
Victor called while in the train and I brieed him of my itenary. He requested I keep him updated. He wants his computer screen replaced. I had asked if he was sure only the lcd had issues and he was assertive. But when I asked how he checked he rambled about not being an expert, and how I should just check and advise me. I calmed him down and tried to tell him how to use an HDMI cable to confirm and he said he didn't have any accessory to do that. I had ended the argurment. This exchanged happened some days back.
