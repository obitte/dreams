        <a class="live">         <h4> Emeka called and argued about how the salary will not enter. And how a shift manager even confirmed it, stating that it will be floated today to be effective tomorrow.
            I explained that since yesterday was weekend, the lon will be floated today, to be effective tomorrow. I told him they will do a idrect transfer today but he doubted that.
            He put me through approving my certificate of employment from Randstad through Ifmetal. I did, and thereafter sent it to TSL. WHile speaking with him, Eric called and I asked for permission to call him 
            back later since I was in a meeting. Later, I called Eric and he proposed he will transfer me to another company to have a partnership. It was obvious he didn't want to have the partnership with me anymore.
            I politely rejected his proposaland rather proposed I run the show solely for one or two months, during which I will look for another partner. I explained how improper it will look to go back to the client and make a switch at this time.
            He wasn't prepared for that. He asked that we discuss this later, which I obliged.
            I got a response/reminder from TSL, and in response to that, I sent them the employment certificate from Randstad AB (i had downloaded it after approval), and wrote Kavallariette AB bankrupcy Trustees.
            I called a trafik school to book appointment for 5pm Wednesday 27th for Risk 1. I asked for another time because I have a cofee date with Malik and family on the same date, even though we had not agreed on time.
